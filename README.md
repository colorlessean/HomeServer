A repository to simply hold all of the development files for home server functions.

Intention is to include many project files with the development files alongside scripts to build and deploy the services to the file system on the intended server.

In future trying to Dockerize or otherwise containerize services to turn into a true server.

Currently contains Projects:
* Simple Node JS server to serve a webpage that will be assessable on the network.
